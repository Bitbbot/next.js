title: 'Babel and `next/font` conflict'

## Why This Error Occurred

You have tried to use `next/font` with a custom babel config. When your application has a custom babel config you opt-out of the Next.js Compiler which is required to use `next/font`.

## Possible Ways to Fix It

- Remove your custom babel config and use the Next.js Compiler
